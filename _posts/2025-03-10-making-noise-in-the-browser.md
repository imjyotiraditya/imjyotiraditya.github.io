excerpt: A not-so-serious look at building SynthWave, struggling with oscillators, and the joy of making your browser scream in musical terror.

So I was messing around with JavaScript recently and stumbled upon this thing called the Web Audio API. My first thought? "Wait, I can make weird sounds directly in the browser without any plugins?" Yep, turns out you can!

## The SynthWave Saga Begins

I'm still pretty new to all this, but a few weeks ago I thought it would be fun to try building a simple synthesizer. I had no idea what I was getting into, but that's how I learn best - just diving in and figuring things out along the way.

Enter **SynthWave** - my first attempt at making browser noises that actually sound somewhat musical. It started with me just wanting to play a single note, and somehow evolved into this whole thing.

At one point, I was testing a new feature late at night and accidentally set the volume way too high. I think my roommate still hasn't forgiven me for that one!

## What I Actually Built

So what does SynthWave actually do? It's pretty simple (because I'm still learning!), but I'm kind of proud of it:

1. **Individual Notes**: You can play single notes from C3 to C5. I originally just wanted to make one note work, but then I thought "why not add more?" and before I knew it I had 15 of them.

2. **Chords**: I realized playing one note at a time was kind of limiting, so I figured out how to make multiple notes play together. Now you can click a button and hear a full chord!

3. **Adjustable Settings**: After some YouTube tutorials and a lot of trial and error, I managed to add options to change the waveform (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle). Each one sounds different, and I'm still not sure which one I like best.

4. **Attack and Release Controls**: I found out about something called ADSR envelope (that's Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release), but I only implemented Attack and Release because I was still trying to understand how they worked.

## Figuring Out the Web Audio API

When I first looked at the Web Audio API documentation, I felt completely lost. There were all these terms I'd never heard of before - oscillators, gain nodes, audio contexts... it was like reading a foreign language.

After a lot of Googling and several "wait, why isn't this making any sound?" moments, I started to get the hang of it. Sort of.

Here's what I learned the code actually looks like:

```javascript
// This is what I had to write just to play one note:
const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();
oscillator.type = "sine";
oscillator.frequency.value = 440; // This is A4
oscillator.connect(gainNode);
gainNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(0, audioContext.currentTime);
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, audioContext.currentTime + 0.1);
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, audioContext.currentTime + 0.5);
oscillator.start();
oscillator.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 0.6);
```

I still don't fully understand all of it, but I've found that if I change the wrong value, I either get silence or a sound that makes me scramble to lower my volume.

## Cool Things I Discovered About Browsers

Before I started this project, I had no idea browsers could do all this audio stuff on their own! I always thought you needed special software to make music.

I'm still learning, but here are some cool things the Web Audio API can apparently do:

- **Real-time audio processing**: You can add effects like echo and reverb right in the browser
- **Visualization**: You can create those cool waveform displays that bounce with the music
- **Audio spatialzation**: You can make sounds seem like they're coming from different directions

## Future Ideas (If I Can Figure Them Out)

I'm not sure if I'll be able to make all of these work, but here are some things I'd like to try adding to SynthWave:

1. **Drum Machine**: Adding some drum sounds to play along with the notes would be cool. I've seen some tutorials on how to load audio samples, so I might try that next.

2. **Simple Sequencer**: It would be fun to be able to record a sequence of notes and have them play back automatically.

3. **More Effects**: I'd love to add some basic effects like reverb or delay. From what I've read, it involves creating more audio nodes and connecting them in different ways.

4. **Better UI**: Right now it's pretty basic. I want to make it look nicer and be more intuitive to use.

5. **Saving Sounds**: It would be neat if you could save your favorite settings or sounds you create.

## Why This Was Fun

I'm still pretty new to web development, but there was something really satisfying about making my browser produce sounds for the first time. Even when I was frustrated because something wasn't working, hearing that first successful note play was worth it.

I spent way too many hours trying to fix bugs (like why my B-flat sounded completely wrong), but each problem I solved taught me something new. That's the fun part of learning by doing - you remember the lessons better when you've struggled a bit.

## Try It Yourself!

If you're curious about my little project, you can check it out at [/synthwave](/synthwave). It's nothing fancy, but I'm kind of proud that it works at all!

Fair warning though: maybe use headphones if you're in a public place. Or don't, and enjoy the confused looks from people around you when your laptop suddenly starts playing random musical notes.

## Conclusion

The Web Audio API is pretty cool, and I've only scratched the surface of what it can do. I'm definitely not an expert - just someone curious who wanted to see what I could build. There were plenty of moments where I had no idea what I was doing, but that's all part of learning.

If you're interested in trying something like this yourself, I'd say go for it! Even if your first attempts sound terrible (mine sure did), it's a fun way to learn about both audio and JavaScript at the same time.

I think the best part is that you don't need any special equipment or software - just a browser and some patience. Who knows what you might create?
